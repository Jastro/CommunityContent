# Vircon32: CommunityContent

This is a repository where the community (in other words, you!) can contribute their own content for Vircon32. Same as in ConsoleSoftware, projects uploaded here are meant to be content for the console itself. This can include several different contributions, so the repository has been organized in the following categories:

- Games
- Playable demos
- Technical demos
- Custom BIOS
- Tutorials and examples
- Libraries to develop games

In the future, if needed, a separate repository will be created to hold custom emulators, compilers or other tools that run externally outside of the console.

--------------------------------------------
### Why a separate repository for the community?

You may wonder: why upload your content here instead of using ConsoleSoftware? The reason is that ConsoleSoftware is meant to serve as an official source. Software from ConsoleSoftware must not only work well, but should have a high enough overall quality to be taken as practical examples for anyone wanting to learn. Those projects have been written following a clear structure, easy to understand code style, and using many comments to point out specifics about the console.

On the other hand, content made by the community will not be subject to these strict rules. It is enough for your projects to follow basic rules (see next section) and that they can be built and run without errors.

--------------------------------------------
### How to contribute?

The way to contribute your own projects is to create a pull request in GitHub (you will need a GitHub account). For that you can either fork this repository and clone it to your computer, or clone the original one and work in a new branch. You would then work with the usual way (using git to do commits) until your project is ready. In that moment you will submit a pull request. Your request will be analyzed in case some problem is found and, if accepted, it will be merged into the main repository for everyone to try!

It is enough for your projects to be built without errors and to run fine.

##### The Readme file
You may want to create a readme.txt or readme.md file to state your project's license, and give credits when appropriate. Remember that people usually won't know about your games or projects! It could be a good idea for your readme to include a small description and maybe some screenshot. 

Also, if your project is a library it is recommended to include some simple example showing your possible users how to use it.

--------------------------------------------
### Rules to submit contributions

All projects uploaded here must first be accepted as a pull request, so they should follow some basic rules:

- Don't use stolen assets, or violate their license of use
- Don't just copy other projects without offering anything of your own
- Have some actual content, not an empty or too unfinished project
- Avoid featuring too violent/erotic/polemic content

I may still reject projects if I think they are inappropriate in some other way. Also, projects that are found to violate the rules after being uploaded may be deleted at any moment.

Of course you are free to make any Vircon32 projects you wish, even outside these rules. But you will have to host it in your own repositories.

----------------------------------
### Please take in mind

To keep things clean, Git has been configured to ignore temporary build files. It is OK to upload the final .v32 binaries, so that people can try your peojects without compiling themselves, but we will try to avoid intermediate results (.vtex, .vsnd, etc) since they take up space and are not needed.

It is encouraged that you configure your build so that these temporary build files will be placed in a folder called 'obj', that way Git will skip the whole folder automatically.

----------------------------------
### License

This repository contains several elements by different authors, so there is no global license. Please check the license or readme files for each of the projects to find out more.

If you contribute to this repository, please let people know of the applicable license for your project. If you use some other software or assets and they have their own licence you should state this as well.
